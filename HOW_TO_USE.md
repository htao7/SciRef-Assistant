# How to Use SciRef Assistant

**SciRef Assistant** is a smart tool for researchers to find context-aware academic references for scientific papers using Google Gemini.

## Quick Start

1.  **Paste Manuscript**: Copy your text into the editor on the left.
2.  **Highlight Text**: Select (highlight) a specific sentence or claim you want to cite.
3.  **Get References**: The assistant automatically analyzes the context of your selection and finds relevant papers in the right-hand panel.

## Features

### 🔍 Search & Filters
*   **Context-Aware**: The AI uses the surrounding text to disambiguate and understand the specific meaning of your highlighted claim.
*   **Filters**: Use the right-hand panel to refine results by **Year**, **Publisher** (e.g., Nature, IEEE), or **Document Type**.
*   **Priority**: Sort results by "Most Cited", "High Impact Journal", or "Newest First".

### 🛠️ Refinement & Learning
*   **Disapprove**: If a reference isn't suitable, click the **Menu (or X)** on the reference card.
*   **Reasoning**: Select a reason (e.g., "Not new", "Not relevant"). The AI learns from this feedback and immediately fetches a better replacement that avoids similar pitfalls.
*   **Verification**: The system automatically verifies URLs and checks that the papers actually exist to prevent hallucinations.

### 📄 Export
*   Click the **Export** button to download your manuscript as a text file.
*   Citations will be inserted into the text as bracketed numbers `[1]`, and a formatted bibliography will be appended to the end of the file.

### 💡 Tips
*   You can have multiple active searches. Just highlight a different part of the text to start a new search.
*   Click on an existing yellow highlight in the text to bring its specific results back into view in the side panel.
